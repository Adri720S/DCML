# Don't use lambda layers in your model.
# You do not need them to solve the question.
# Lambda layers are not supported by the grading infrastructure.
# There are 5 questions in this exam with increasing difficulty from 1-5.
# Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative to its
# difficulty. So your Category 1 question will score significantly less than
# your Category 5 question.

# Basic Datasets Question
#
# Create a classifier for the Fashion MNIST dataset
# Note that the test will expect it to classify 10 classes and that the
# input shape should be the native size of the Fashion MNIST dataset which is
# 28x28 monochrome. Do not resize the data. Your input layer should accept
# (28,28,1) as the input shape only. And make sure your model training and validations performance above 90.  If you amend this, the tests will fail.
